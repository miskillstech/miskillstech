				# Why are fastcgi params needed?
				# Any time that a proxy connection is made, the original request must be translated to ensure that the proxied request makes sense to the backend server.
				# Since we are changing protocols with a FastCGI pass, this involves some additional work.
				# While http-to-http proxying mainly involves augmenting http headers to ensure that the backend has the information it needs to respond to the proxy server on behalf of the client,
				# FastCGI is a separate protocol that cannot read http headers. Due to this consideration, any pertinent information must be passed to the backend through other means.
				# The primary method of passing extra information when using the FastCGI protocol is with parameters. The background server should be configured to read and process these,
				# modifying its behavior depending on what it finds. Nginx can set FastCGI parameters using the fastcgi_param directive.

						# Q) Why is the following modification done to REQUEST_URI?
				# REQUEST_URI has the name of the script that needs to be executed.
				# Since the word api comes from the location we need to remove the word api before sending the name of the script to fastcgi.
